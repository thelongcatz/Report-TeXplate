# Report TeXplate â€“ Your Report in LaTeX
[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This repository contains my report template in LaTeX for the Oxford Physics Practical Course, B8/B9 project option and the MPhys project. It consists of two components: the root template `report_template.tex` and the custom class definition `thelongcat-report.cls`.

The LaTeX report consists of the following sections, which are split into separate files for ease of writing and version tracking:
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Theory
- Implementation
- Results and Discussion
- Conclusion
- References\*
- Appendix (optional)

\* For a more sane writing experience, I recommend the use of [BibLaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/Getting_started_with_BibLaTeX) in conjunction with a reference manager such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
